## üé® Customization

### Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS with a custom design system:

```css
/* Primary Colors */
--color-primary: #2563EB;
--color-success: #059669;
--color-warning: #D97706;
--color-error: #DC2626;

/* Typography */
--font-family: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
--font-size-base: 14px;
--line-height-base: 1.5;
```

### Adding New Analysis Features

1. **Extend ResumeAnalysis Interface:**
```typescript
interface ResumeAnalysis {
  // ... existing fields
  customField: CustomAnalysis;
}
```

2. **Update Analysis Function:**
```typescript
const analyzeResume = (content: string): ResumeAnalysis => {
  // ... existing analysis
  const customField = performCustomAnalysis(content);
  
  return {
    // ... existing fields
    customField
  };
};
```

3. **Update UI Components:**
Add new sections to `ResultsTable.tsx` to display custom analysis.

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Best Practices

1. **Large Resume Sets**: Process resumes in batches for better performance
2. **Memory Management**: Clear processed data when switching job descriptions
3. **Caching**: Results are cached until job description changes
4. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes

### Monitoring

The application includes built-in performance monitoring:
- Processing time tracking
- Memory usage indicators
- Real-time status updates

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All processing happens client-side
- No resume data is sent to external servers
- Local storage only for temporary caching

### Input Validation
- File type restrictions (TXT only)
- Content sanitization
- Size limits for uploaded files
